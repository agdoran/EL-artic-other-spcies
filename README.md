# EL-artic-other-spcies
modification of the EPI2ME Labs (https://labs.epi2me.io/)
artic workflow for SARS-CoV-2 to enable the analysis of other
species. This is not a complete project and you will likely
run into errors in the current version, however this should
act as a template to help users investigate the code sections
which need to be modified to enable this. WIP (spare time
project - absolutely no timelines). Also, workflow comes with
no guarantee of usefulness or accuracy. Forking and modification
is welcome, in which case it would be better to go to the
original repository on the EPI2ME Labs pages.
